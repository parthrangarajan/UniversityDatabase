# UniversityDatabase
A university database using MySql and Python.


MySQL is a Relational Database Language that implements Structured Query Language. This project was aimed to simulate an actual University Database.\
There are a total of 7 views, 10 triggers, 2 cursors, 3 procedures, 5 functions and 17 tables. The entire database has been modelled on 2 sections, one Students the other Staff.
Each Section has its own specific tables and other implementations(cursors, views, triggers, procedures and functions). There are many types of relations inplemented and relational tables have been created to specify relations that occur between 2 tables. There are other special tables as well that are only filled in where a particular trigger is invoked. The project also use python and its **mysql.connecter()** class to connect the Database to Python and give it a GUI type feel.
